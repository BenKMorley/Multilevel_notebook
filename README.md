This notebook lays out the code used for an investigation into the effect of the correlation
length on the performance of the multilevel algorithm. This investigation was presented at the
annual lattice physics conference (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1006302/contributions/4381218/).

To use this notebook, one needs to change the line in the second cell

base_directory = "/mnt/drive1/Multilevel_data/"

to an appropriate directory in the users system where the data produced by this Notebook will be
reproduced if one re-runs the code.
