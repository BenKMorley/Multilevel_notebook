This notebook lays out the code used for an investigation into the effect of the correlation
length on the performance of the multilevel algorithm. This investigation was presented at the
annual lattice physics conference (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1006302/contributions/4381218/).

To use this notebook, one needs to change the line in the second cell

base_directory = "/mnt/drive1/Multilevel_data/"

to an appropriate directory in the users system where the data produced by this notebook will be
reproduced if one re-runs the code. 

The main numerical results take significant time to produce on a standard PC (6 - 24 hours). All
the figures of the notebook are already produced in the output cells, so the user can choose to
simply read the notebook if they wish.
